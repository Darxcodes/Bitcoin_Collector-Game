Description:a simple and interactive Click Game built using JavaScript! The game challenges players to click a button as fast as possible to score points. It was a fun way to practice my JavaScript skills, focusing on event handling and DOM manipulation.

Technologies used:

HTML/CSS for the structure and styling.
JavaScript for game logic and interactivity.
